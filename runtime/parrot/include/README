This directory contains mostly generated files:
- include files with constants defined somewhere in the interpreter
  (see config/gen/parrot_include.pl for details)
- configuration data (config.fpmc)
- bytecode used at runtime (parrotlib.pbc)

Additionally there are some snippets of PIR code:
- hllmacros.pir provides some nifty PIR macros
- test_more.pir provides boilerplate code for test scripts written in PIR

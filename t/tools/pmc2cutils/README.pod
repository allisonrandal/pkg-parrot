=head1 NAME

t/tools/pmc2cutils/README.pod - Readme file for the 't/tools/pmc2cutils'
directory. 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This directory contains test code for Parrot::Pmc2c::Pmc2cMain, a Perl5
module whose publicly callable methods and other subroutines supply
functionality to Parrot build tool F<tools/build/pmc2c.pl>.

F<pmc2c.pl> is invoked many times during 'make', so it is important that
Parrot developers be able to understand and, if necessary, refactor its
component parts.  The tests in this directory serve to illustrate those
parts.  They should be run by any developer refactoring F<pmc2c.pl> or
the many modules underlying that program.

However, since the processes they test precede the creation of the
'parrot' executable, failures of these tests do not necessarily indicate
problems with that executable.  For this reason, these tests are not
included in the 'make test' or 'make fulltest' targets.  They can,
however, be run as part of 'make buildtools_tests' and developers are
encouraged to do so.

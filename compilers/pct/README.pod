=head1 Parrot Compiler Toolkit (PCT)

This is an implementation of an abstract tree representation
and compiler for Parrot.  This version is a redesign based
on PAST-pm.  Only simple nodes are available, but it will
expand rapidly.

PCT is used for example by F<compilers/nqp>, F<languages/abc>, F<languages/perl6>
and F<languages/pipp>.

XXX
XXX a lot of the JAPHs are currently broken due to recent core changes
XXX some of them have been removed as doomed never to work again
XXX

These programs show very different ways how to print a simple
string. Some are obfuscated, some are horribly platform dependend.

To run them all:

$ make -C examples/compilers  # [1]
$ for f in examples/japh/japh*.pasm; do ./parrot $f ; done

Note: japh16 is using a shared lib, which is built by [1]

These JAPHs are also tested by 'make test' in the Parrot root directory.
The test file is 't/examples/japh.t'.

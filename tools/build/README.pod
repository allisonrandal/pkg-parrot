=head1 NAME

tools/build/README.pod - Readme file for the 'tools/build/' directory. 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This directory is intended to hold programs, templates and configuration files
invoked by the default 'make' target ('make all'), with or without
command-line options, during the Parrot build process.

Programs, templates and configuration files invoked by 'make install' or
'make install-dev' should be placed in tools/release/.

Other things being equal, programs, templates and configuration files invoked
by all other 'make' targets (I<e.g.>, 'make headerizer') should be placed in
tools/dev/.

This is a Parrot m4, a Parrot port of GNU m4.

Parrot m4 is written in the Parrot Intermediate Language PIR.
For now it doesn't do much, but it is supposed to become 
a drop in replacement for GNU m4.

The purpose of the port is firstly educational, 
and secondly a test case for more involved languages.
Actually I found that m4 is already pretty involved.

Parrot m4 is under the GPL. See LICENSE.
